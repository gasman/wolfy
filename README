wolfy

a Wolfenstein 3D raycasting engine for the r0ket platform:
https://r0ket.badge.events.ccc.de/

WORK IN PROGRESS:
currently we have vertical walls, but the projection is slightly glitchy

build instructions:
stick wolfy.c and wall.h into the firmware/l0dables directory
of your r0ket codebase checkout, then follow the standard procedure
for building a l0dable:

cd firmware/l0dables
make wolfy.c0d

or for the simulat0r:
cd simulat0r
make APP=l0dable LAPP=wolfy

png2cdata.py is a python script for converting wall.png to wall.h (requires PIL).
